                <p class="zar-txt">One of the key musical rituals we wanted to experience before Ramadan begins is the African healing ceremony known as zar.  
                    Zar is comparable to the Gnawa lila in Morocco in the sense that it is a tradition rooted in the pre-Islamic life of sub-Saharan Africa 
                    that has been accommodated to the Arabic, Islamic north.  It is also about healing through 
                    driving out bad spirits.  Spirits, or djinns, are recognized by Islam, but the notion of
                     driving them out using music, rhythm and trance, is not to be found in the Koran, or any 
                     other official Islamic teaching.  Indeed, during the long buildup to the zar we experienced,
                      a loud call to prayer echoed through the narrow alleyway where we were waiting not once but
                       twice.  As best we could see, no one answered it.  "Because the two things are in conflict,"
                        our guide opined.  You begin to see why these rituals are not performed during the holy moth
                         of Ramadan.</p>
